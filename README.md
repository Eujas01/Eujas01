👋 Hi, I’m @Eujas01

👀 I’m interested in programming and coding. I love exploring different languages and frameworks, and I’m always up for collaborating on exciting projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Java, Python, and JavaScript. Each language offers me a different perspective, and I’m keen on building diverse and efficient solutions.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, especially those that can help me hone my skills in the languages I’m learning. If you have a project that could use a fresh pair of eyes or a passionate developer, feel free to reach out!

📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at eujas01@gmail.com. I’m always open to connect and collaborate!
